description: The She Archive is a digital museum dedicated to preserving the
  forgotten women who shaped history, culture, and technology, without
  recognition. This is our beginning.

**History is incomplete.**

Not because it lacks achievements, but because it omitted the women behind them.

The She Archive exists to document what was overlooked, erased, or quietly absorbed into the work of others. Across centuries and disciplines, women have built systems, shaped ideas, advanced technology, and moved culture forward, often without authorship, credit, or legacy.

This is not a space for myth-making.

This is a space for **record-keeping, inspiration and more**.

We treat women’s contributions as historical fact, not footnotes. Each entry in The She Archive restores a name, a story, and a context, placing women back into the timelines they were removed from.

This is a digital museum.

A living archive.

A corrective record.

From science to software, art to resistance, domestic labor to global innovation, **her work was never absent. It was undocumented. Or it was documented but not well known!**

The She Archive begins here.

Thank you!

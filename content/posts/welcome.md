# Welcome!

This is a test post to verify that the **Decap CMS** integration and the custom blog engine are working correctly.

If you can see this, it means:
1. The build script generated `api/posts.json`.
2. The `blog.html` page fetched it successfully.
3. The `post.html` page loaded this content!

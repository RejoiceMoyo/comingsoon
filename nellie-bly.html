                            <h2 class="brand-heading text-3xl">Introduction</h2>
                            <p>Nellie Bly was a trailblazing journalist and adventurer whose fearless reporting challenged societal norms and brought attention to critical social issues. Born Elizabeth Cochrane Seaman, Bly became famous for her undercover investigations, most notably exposing the harsh conditions of mental asylums in the late 19th century. She also captured the public’s imagination by traveling around the world in 72 days, inspired by Jules Verne’s fictional character Phileas Fogg. Bly’s courage, intelligence, and determination not only revolutionized investigative journalism but also opened doors for women in media during a time when the field was dominated by men.</p>

                            <h2 class="brand-heading text-3xl">Early Life</h2>
                            <p>Nellie Bly was born Elizabeth Jane Cochran on May 5, 1864, in Cochran’s Mills, Pennsylvania. She grew up in a modest household and experienced her father’s death at a young age, which forced her family into financial hardship. Despite these challenges, Bly was determined to pursue education and began writing poetry and articles for local newspapers as a teenager. Her early exposure to writing and storytelling cultivated her curiosity about society and her desire to shed light on injustices.</p>
                            <p>By the age of 18, Bly had moved to Pittsburgh to work as a reporter for the “Pittsburgh Dispatch,” adopting the pen name “Nellie Bly,” inspired by a popular song of the time. She quickly gained a reputation for her bold reporting style and willingness to tackle subjects that other journalists avoided, including women’s rights, labor conditions, and social reform.</p>

                            <h2 class="brand-heading text-3xl">Her Work</h2>
                            <p>Bly’s most famous work came in 1887 when she feigned mental illness to gain admission to the Women’s Lunatic Asylum on Blackwell’s Island, New York. Posing as a patient, she observed and documented appalling conditions, including overcrowding, abuse, and neglect. Her exposé, published as a series in the New York World newspaper, shocked the public and led to significant reforms in mental health care. This groundbreaking investigative journalism demonstrated Bly’s ingenuity, bravery, and commitment to truth.</p>
                            <p>In addition to her asylum investigation, Bly undertook other daring assignments, including reporting on women laborers, immigrant conditions, and poverty in urban areas. In 1889, she embarked on a journey to travel around the world, completing the trip in just 72 days. This feat garnered international attention, proving that women could accomplish extraordinary feats in fields traditionally dominated by men. Throughout her career, Bly combined courage, innovation, and storytelling to illuminate hidden truths in society.</p>

title: "About The She Archive"
mission_short: "A digital repository dedicated to recovering and documenting the erased histories of women in science, technology, and innovation."
foundation: |
  The She Archive was founded on the belief that history is incomplete. For centuries, the contributions of women have been marginalized, misattributed, or entirely omitted from the historical record. This archive exists to bridge that gap, providing a centralized, meticulously researched space for these stories to live.
what_we_do: |
  We document the lives, inventions, and breakthroughs of women throughout history. Our work involves:
  - Archival research into primary and secondary sources.
  - Digital preservation of historical narratives.
  - Educational outreach to bring these stories to light.
philosophy: |
  We approach history with a commitment to accuracy, nuance, and intersectionality. We acknowledge that erasure is often systemic, and our editorial process seeks to address these biases by highlighting not just the achievements, but the barriers faced by our subjects.
scope: |
  Our focus spans all eras and geographies, with a particular emphasis on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and social innovation.
methodology: |
  Every entry is backed by research from academic journals, patent records, and historical archives. We prioritize primary sources where available and cite all references using APA standards.
funding: |
  The She Archive is currently an independent project. We are committed to transparency regarding our sustainability and independence.

closing: |
  Honoring the past to inspire the future of innovation.

                            <h2 class="brand-heading text-3xl">Introduction</h2>
                            <p>Rosalind Elsie Franklin was a pioneering scientist whose meticulous research was crucial in revealing the structure of DNA, the molecule of life. Despite her indispensable contributions, her work was largely overshadowed by her male contemporaries, James Watson and Francis Crick, who received the lion’s share of recognition for the discovery of the DNA double helix. Franklin's mastery of X-ray crystallography and her careful, data-driven approach provided the foundation for understanding the helical structure of DNA, a discovery that revolutionized biology and medicine. Today, her story serves as both an inspiration and a cautionary tale, highlighting the systemic biases that historically undervalued women in science.</p>

                            <h2 class="brand-heading text-3xl">Early Life</h2>
                            <p>Rosalind Franklin was born on July 25, 1920, in London, England, to a wealthy and intellectually curious family. She was one of five children in a household that emphasized education, critical thinking, and public service. Her father, Ellis Franklin, was a banker, and her mother, Muriel, was highly involved in social work and charitable activities. From a young age, Franklin demonstrated a keen interest in science and mathematics, excelling in her school studies and earning a scholarship to Newnham College, Cambridge.</p>
                            <p>At Cambridge, Franklin specialized in physical chemistry and was exposed to advanced laboratory techniques. She earned a degree in natural sciences in 1941, distinguishing herself in the male-dominated field of chemistry. After graduation, she spent several years conducting research on the molecular structures of coal and carbon, developing skills that would later become critical for her work on DNA. This early experience honed her analytical precision and experimental rigor, setting her apart as a scientist committed to accuracy and evidence.</p>

                            <h2 class="brand-heading text-3xl">Her Work</h2>
                            <p>In the early 1950s, Franklin joined King’s College London, where she focused on using X-ray crystallography to study DNA fibers. X-ray crystallography is a technique that allows scientists to visualize the molecular arrangement of crystals by observing how X-rays scatter off them. Franklin’s exceptional skill with this method enabled her to produce the now-famous “Photograph 51,” a high-resolution image that revealed the helical nature of DNA.</p>
                            <p>Photograph 51 provided critical information about DNA's dimensions and structural characteristics, which Watson and Crick used to build their iconic double helix model. Beyond DNA, Franklin also conducted significant research on viruses, including tobacco mosaic virus and the poliovirus, demonstrating her versatility as a molecular biologist. Her work extended into the study of carbon and coal structures, showcasing her deep understanding of chemistry and molecular physics.</p>

                            <h2 class="brand-heading text-3xl">Why History Forgot Her</h2>
                            <p>Despite the centrality of her work, Franklin did not receive the recognition she deserved during her lifetime. Watson and Crick were able to access her data, sometimes without her explicit consent, and published the double helix model in 1953, which ultimately earned them the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962. Franklin had passed away from ovarian cancer in 1958, before the Nobel was awarded (and Nobel prizes are not awarded posthumously), but her contributions were still undervalued by many in the scientific community at the time.</p>
                            <p>Several factors contributed to this oversight. Gender bias in the 1950s scientific world made it difficult for women to receive credit equal to their male peers. Franklin was known for her precise, careful approach, and her reluctance to self-promote contrasted with the more assertive, sometimes aggressive behavior of her male colleagues. Her personality, combined with systemic sexism, contributed to her work being underappreciated and often misattributed.</p>

                            <h2 class="brand-heading text-3xl">Legacy</h2>
                            <p>Today, Rosalind Franklin is recognized as one of the most important figures in molecular biology. Her contributions to understanding DNA have been widely acknowledged in books, biographies, and documentaries. Institutions, awards, and scholarships now bear her name, ensuring her legacy inspires new generations of scientists, especially women in STEM. Franklin’s story reminds us that groundbreaking science often requires collaboration, and it is crucial to give credit to all contributors, regardless of gender or personality.</p>
                            <p>Her meticulous methods, intellectual rigor, and dedication to empirical evidence continue to influence the way molecular biology and genetics are studied. Franklin’s life serves as both a beacon of inspiration and a reminder of the barriers women have historically faced in science, encouraging modern researchers to pursue truth with precision and courage.</p>
